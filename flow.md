# BeforeAfterUI â€“ User Flow (ENGLISH)

BeforeAfterUI is a web application that leverages AI to compare the current interface of an application (using screenshots and code) with a target design mockup. The AI analyzes the differences and guides the developer to transform the existing interface so that it matches the target design, regardless of the framework or technology used (React, Vue, Flutter, etc.).

**Detailed User Flow:**

1. **Project Initialization**

   - The user creates a new project.
   - The user either selects the technology stack manually or lets the AI detect it automatically by analyzing the uploaded code.

2. **Importing Current State**

   - The user uploads screenshots of the current application UI.
   - The user uploads the corresponding source code for each screenshot (multiple frameworks and languages supported).

3. **Importing Target Design**

   - The user uploads the target design mockup (from Figma, Sketch, PSD, or as images/screenshots).

4. **AI Analysis & Comparison**

   - The AI, via API calls to providers like OpenAI, Google, AWS, or Azure, analyzes both the current UI and the target design.
   - The AI detects UI elements, layout, design tokens, and visual hierarchy in both versions.
   - The AI highlights meaningful differences by component type and visual attributes.

5. **AI-Driven Suggestions**

   - The AI generates precise, technology-specific code modification suggestions to transform the current UI into the target design.
   - Suggestions are tailored to the detected or selected technology stack.

6. **Implementation & Iteration**

   - The user applies the AI-recommended changes to the codebase.
   - The user uploads a new screenshot of the updated UI.
   - The AI evaluates the new implementation, provides feedback, and suggests further improvements if needed.
   - This cycle repeats until the UI matches the target design.

7. **Continuous AI Support**
   - All intelligence (analysis, suggestions, vision, code generation, etc.) is provided via secure API calls to major AI providers (OpenAI, Google, AWS, Azure).
   - The system is designed to accelerate and secure UI transformation for any technology stack using cloud-based AI.

**Goal:**

Accelerate and secure the transformation of user interfaces, regardless of the technical stack, thanks to AI-powered automation and guidance.
