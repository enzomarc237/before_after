### **State Management**
- **Project Store**: CRUD operations, image management
- **AI Settings Store**: Provider configuration, model selection
- **Persistent Storage**: localStorage for offline capability

### **Type Safety**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Type-safe API calls (ready for backend)
- Proper error handling and validation

## 📊 **Build Status**

```bash
✅ TypeScript Compilation: SUCCESS
✅ Next.js Build: SUCCESS  
✅ ESLint: PASSING (only img warnings)
✅ Production Ready: YES
```

**Warnings**: Only Next.js img element warnings (expected for MVP)

## 🎮 **How to Test**

### **Quick Demo**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### **Test Flow**
1. **Dashboard** → See welcome screen
2. **Create Project** → Add "My React App Redesign"
3. **Upload Images** → Add current and target screenshots
4. **Settings** → Configure OpenAI with your API key
5. **Compare** → Run mock analysis and see results

## 🔮 **Ready for Next Phase**

### **Backend Integration** (Next Sprint)
- NestJS API server
